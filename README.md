# **DeepFolio | Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) for Portfolio & Execution Optimization**  

DeepFolio is an **OpenAI Sora-inspired Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework** for **joint portfolio optimization and best execution**, designed to **maximize Sharpe ratio without explicit return forecasts**. It leverages:  
- **Transformer** to capture asset dependencies and encode market conditions.  
- **Diffusion Models** to filter market noise and generate both **robust allocation weights** and **optimized trading trajectories**.  
- **End-to-End Strategy Execution** to reduce information loss between **strategy design and execution implementation**, ensuring optimal real-world performance.

## **üöÄ Key Features**
‚úÖ **Unified Portfolio & Execution Optimization** ‚Äì Bridges the gap between portfolio construction and trade execution.  
‚úÖ **Diffusion-Based Portfolio Generation** ‚Äì Generates **adaptive, robust asset allocations** without relying on explicit return forecasts.  
‚úÖ **Market-Aware Execution Path Modeling** ‚Äì Uses **Diffusion Models** to optimize **execution trajectories**, reducing slippage and market impact.  
‚úÖ **Scenario-Based Adaptation** ‚Äì Dynamically adjusts strategies for **high/low volatility regimes, liquidity shifts, and market anomalies**.  
‚úÖ **Transaction Cost-Aware Optimization** ‚Äì Integrates **TCA (Transaction Cost Analysis)** into optimization, minimizing execution costs.

## **üìú Architecture**
DeepFolio consists of **two core modules**:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Optimization** (Transformer + Diffusion)  
- **Transformer Encoder** extracts asset relationships, learning market structure.  
- **Diffusion Model** generates optimal portfolio weights, ensuring robustness under different conditions.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Optimization** (Trade Path Diffusion)  
- **Transformer encodes market microstructure (LOB, liquidity, volatility).**  
- **Diffusion Model optimizes execution paths** to minimize market impact and transaction costs.  

üìå **Pipeline Overview**:
